# Data Structures and Algorithms Assessment

This repository contains Python code examples for solving three different programming problems. Each problem is described below, along with the corresponding code implementation.

## Problem 1: Balanced Expressions

### Description

The `is_balanced(expression)` function checks whether a given expression containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

### Usage

```python
expression1 = "([]{})"
expression2 = "([)]"
print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False
Problem 2: Remove Duplicates
Description
The remove_duplicates(sequence) function takes a sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates removed while maintaining the original order of elements.

Usage
python
Copy code
input_sequence = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 5]
result = remove_duplicates(input_sequence)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Problem 3: Word Frequency
Description
The word_frequency(sentence) function takes a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the sentence. It ignores punctuation and considers words in a case-insensitive manner.

Usage
python
Copy code
sentence = "This is a test sentence. This sentence is a test."
result = word_frequency(sentence)
print(result)
These code examples demonstrate how to solve these common programming problems in Python. Feel free to use and modify the code as needed for your own projects.

Enjoy coding!
